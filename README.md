It involves the use of mathematical and computational techniques to make predictions about future carbon and other emissions based on historical data and scientific understanding of the Earth's climate system. This type of modeling plays a crucial role in assessing potential impacts of climate change and in developing strategies for mitigation and adaptation. Here's a general overview of the methodology behind carbon emissions predictive modeling
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather historical climate data, which includes emissions , state wise share of emissions, temperature, etc. Collect data from various sources such as weather stations, satellites, ocean buoys, and climate models. Clean and preprocess the data to remove outliers, correct errors, and fill in missing values.

Check for stationary datasets: Check stationarity of data sets using Dickey Fuller Algorithm, and eliminate any trends by transforming the non-stationary data using unit-root or differencing methods.

Identify ARIMA Parameters: To get the optimum results , find out the best p,q, and d values that holds the least value of ACF and PACF.

Model Calibration and Validation: Divide and run the model on train-test splits to a prior date for validating the forecast results.
